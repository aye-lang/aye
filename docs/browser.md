# anyknown browser

A web browser written in Ore, for two kinds of users at once:

- **Humans** get a window: address bar, back and forward, scrolling,
  links, forms, and pages with CSS and JavaScript.
- **AI agents** get the same engine without pixels: a page as clean
  Markdown, an accessibility tree whose interactive elements carry
  stable refs (`[e12] link "Docs"`), and actions on those refs (`click
  e12`, `type e7 "query"`). Agents talk to it over stdio as an MCP
  server or as JSON lines. A human window can also accept an agent, so
  both can drive one page and see what the other did.

It is the P3 validation of design.md: DOM nodes live in `Pool(Node)`, JS
holds `Handle(Node)`, everything is allocated explicitly, and the engine
only calls C for the platform (SDL2 for windows and input, FreeType for
glyphs, libcurl for HTTP and TLS). Parsing, style, layout, painting,
JavaScript and the agent protocol are Ore.

## Layout of the code

```
browser/
  main.ore        CLI: window mode, `dump`, `agent`, `mcp`
  url/            URL parsing and resolution (WHATWG subset)
  net/            fetch: file:, data:, http(s) through libcurl, cache
  html/           tokenizer and tree builder (WHATWG subset), entities
  dom/            Node, Document, Pool(Node), queries, mutation
  css/            tokenizer, parser, selectors, cascade, computed style
  layout/         block, inline (line breaking), lists, tables (simple),
                  flex (simple), text measurement
  engine/         Page (load, style, layout), Tab (history, scroll),
                  hit testing, find in page
  paint/          display list, software rasterizer, glyph cache, PNG
  js/             lexer, parser, interpreter, GC, builtins, DOM bindings
  agent/          snapshot (a11y tree with refs), Markdown, actions,
                  JSON-lines and MCP stdio servers
  ui/             SDL2 window, chrome (address bar, tabs), input
  tests/          fixtures (HTML/CSS/JS) and golden outputs
```

## Milestones

Same rules as `milestones.md`: tests first; a milestone is done when its
acceptance tests pass. Tests run headless and offline (`file:` fixtures
and a local test server), so CI needs no network and no display.

### B1: Fetch, HTML, DOM, text

- URL parsing and relative resolution; fetch for `file:`, `data:`,
  `http:` and `https:` (libcurl), with redirects and charset sniffing
  (UTF-8 and Latin-1).
- HTML tokenizer (data, tags, attributes, comments, doctype, character
  references, raw text for `script`/`style`, RCDATA for `title`/
  `textarea`) and a tree builder with implied `html`/`head`/`body`,
  void elements, auto-closing `p`/`li`/`td`/... and misnested formatting
  tags handled simply. It never fails.
- DOM in `Pool(Node)`: elements, text, comments; attributes;
  `getElementById`, `getElementsByTagName`, parent/children/siblings.
- **Acceptance:** `anyknown dump --tree FILE` and `anyknown dump --text
  FILE` golden tests on 20 fixtures, including malformed HTML.

### B2: CSS and style

- CSS tokenizer and parser (rules, declarations, `@media` with
  `screen`/width conditions, other at-rules skipped).
- Selectors: type, `.class`, `#id`, `*`, attribute (`[a]`, `[a=v]`),
  descendant, child, sibling combinators, `:first-child`, `:last-child`,
  `:not()`, `:hover`, `:link`, lists.
- Cascade with specificity, `!important`, inline `style`, a UA
  stylesheet, inheritance, `inherit`/`initial`.
- Computed values: display, position (static/relative), color,
  background-color, font-size/weight/style/family, line-height,
  margin/padding/border (widths, colors, styles), width/height/min/max,
  text-align, text-decoration, white-space, list-style-type, visibility,
  overflow; units px, em, rem, %, vw/vh, named and hex/rgb() colors.
- **Acceptance:** `anyknown dump --style` golden tests.

### B3: Layout

- Block formatting (margins with collapsing between siblings), inline
  formatting with line breaking and `white-space`, `text-align`, list
  markers, `<br>`, `<hr>`, replaced elements with intrinsic size
  (`img` placeholder boxes), simple tables (auto column widths), simple
  flexbox (row/column, gap, justify-content, align-items, flex-grow).
- Text measurement through FreeType with a bundled-path fallback font;
  headless tests use a fixed-metric font so goldens are stable.
- **Acceptance:** `anyknown dump --layout` golden tests (box tree with
  coordinates).

### B4: Paint and window

- Display list (rects, borders, text runs, images); software rasterizer
  into an RGBA buffer with alpha-blended glyphs from a glyph cache.
- `anyknown screenshot FILE -o out.png` (PNG encoder in Ore).
- SDL2 window: address bar, back/forward/reload, scrolling (wheel and
  keys), hover cursor on links, clicking links, window resize, Cmd+L,
  Cmd+[ and Cmd+], find in page (Cmd+F).
- **Acceptance:** screenshot golden tests compared by pixel hash; a
  manual checklist run once per milestone for the window.
- Done: `anyknown screenshot FILE|URL -o out.png [--width W] [--height
  H] [--font fixed|system] [--full]` and `anyknown [open] FILE|URL`.
  Golden PNGs (`browser/tests/paint/`, fixed font, compared byte for
  byte), PNG checks, and headless window tests (SDL's dummy driver,
  `--frames N` with scripted `--events`, `--state`, `--save`; see
  `browser/ui/script.ore`). The interactive checks are in
  `docs/browser-manual-checklist.md`. Simplifications: painting follows
  tree order (no z-index or stacking contexts), clips are rectangles,
  the 3-D border styles are solid, and the style sheets are parsed again
  when the window is resized.

### B5: Forms and images

- `input` (text, password, checkbox, radio, submit), `button`,
  `textarea`, `select`; focus and keyboard editing; form submission by
  GET and POST (urlencoded).
- Images: PNG (zlib inflate in Ore) and GIF first frame; JPEG through
  a later milestone.
- **Acceptance:** a fixture form submitted to the local test server
  produces the expected request; image fixtures render to golden
  screenshots.

### B6: JavaScript

- Lexer, parser and tree-walking interpreter for an ES5 core plus
  `let`/`const`, arrow functions, template literals, classes,
  destructuring (simple), spread, `for...of`; closures, prototypes,
  exceptions; `Object`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, `Math`, `JSON`,
  `Date.now`, `console`.
- Mark-and-sweep GC over the interpreter's own heap.
- DOM bindings following design.md's JS boundary: wrappers hold
  `Handle(Node)` and a `js_refs` count. `document.getElementById`,
  `querySelector(All)`, `createElement`, `appendChild`,
  `removeChild`, `textContent`, `innerHTML` (set), `setAttribute`,
  `classList`, `style.*`, `addEventListener` (click, input, submit,
  keydown, DOMContentLoaded, load), `setTimeout`, `fetch` (simple).
- **Acceptance:** a JS conformance suite of 150 small scripts with
  golden console output; DOM fixtures whose `dump --tree` after scripts
  matches goldens; a to-do app fixture that works in the window.

### B7: Agent interface

- `anyknown agent`: JSON lines on stdio. Commands: `navigate`, `back`,
  `forward`, `reload`, `snapshot` (accessibility tree with refs, roles,
  names, values, states), `read` (Markdown of the main content with
  link refs), `click`, `type`, `select`, `press`, `scroll`, `eval`,
  `screenshot`, `wait` (for load or a selector), `tabs`.
- `anyknown mcp`: the same commands as MCP tools over stdio JSON-RPC.
- `anyknown --agent-socket PATH` with the window: a human and an agent
  share the page; agent actions are highlighted in the window.
- **Acceptance:** scripted agent sessions over fixtures (fill and submit
  a form, follow a link by ref, read a JS-rendered list) with golden
  transcripts; an MCP handshake and `tools/list` golden.

### B8: The real web

- HTTPS sites render readably and agents can operate them: a fixed list
  of public pages (example.com, a Wikipedia article, Hacker News, a
  documentation site) checked manually and recorded in
  `docs/browser-sites.md`; cookies, gzip, `<meta charset>`, `<base>`,
  `<noscript>`.
